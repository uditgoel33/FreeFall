# FreeFall

There are a few different times in history when computing has had a significant effect on the world. This isn't always large scale political events, sometimes it's the capturing of an audience and setting up a culture that will reverberate for decades. The Golden Age of Arcade Games is thought to have lasted from the 1970s through to about 1983. In 1982, arcade games made more money in the USA than both their music industry and film industry combined.  

# Welcome to Freefall. 

This is a game that's based on some of the classics of the Golden Age, the vertical shooters like Space Invaders and Galaga. An array based command line game where the player must defend against falling stones!
